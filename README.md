# Unsupervised Learning
## Intrusion Detection System

### Overview

The goal of intrusion detection is to correctly distinguish between when the system is under attack and when the system is not under attack. The goal of this project is to minimize the number of false positives (ideally to zero) while at the same time maximizing the number of true positives. The code in this repository achieves this goal:

* The supplied model achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.886 on the test set (1.0 is perfect correlation, 0.0 is random guessing)

* The supplied model achieves a true positive rate of 0.840 on the test set (1.0 is best value)

* The supplied model achieves a false positive rate of 0.005 on the test set (0.0 is best value)

### Domain

Industrial control systems (ICS) are computer systems that control the operation of industrial processes and historically have been designed to be operated in isolated environments. Increasingly over time components of these systems have been integrated into larger corporate networks and connected to the Internet without a corresponding attention to security. One domain where this has occurred is water distribution systems with the adoption of smart water technologies.

The Battle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms ([BATADAL](https://www.batadal.net)) was a recent competition to compare the performance of attack detection algorithms specifically for water distribution systems. There are three datasets provided by the [competition's website](https://www.batadal.net/data.html). They provide a simulated attack against a real, moderately-sized [water distribution system](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kegong_Diao/publication/235694686_Battle_of_the_Water_Calibration_Networks/links/00b7d5229e0cfe9afc000000.pdf). Each was generated by running extended-time hydraulic simulations with [EPANET toolkit](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET-Matlab-Toolkit).
